## Second Part of the TODO list, adding fetch

Fecht is the way to be able to connect the web application to an API, in this way you can work with a database to save depending on the project, data, or progress of it.

The purpose of the project is to be able to connect the Todo list to an API to be able to save the tasks that are entered in it, using `GET` we can specify in the code where the data entered through an API URL will be directed, access to a resource and the `PUT` to replace the state of the information already existing in the system.
